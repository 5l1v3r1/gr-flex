# GNU Radio Flex Blocks (gr-flex)

An out-of-tree GNU Radio block for communicating with the FlexRadio

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This project uses a .Net library called FlexlibMono which I have forked and included as a submodule within this project.  You will need to run

`git submodule update --init`

### Prerequisites

You will need the following pre-requisites installed on your machine (in this order):
> For OS-specific install instructions see the below sections for [Linux](#Linux) and [macOS](macOS).

- [GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (**required by GNU Radio**, gr-flex was tested with 2.7)
- [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) **(only for MacOS/Linux systems)**
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) **(already installed if Python 2 >=2.7.9 is installed)**
- [PythonNet]
- [cmake](cmake.org)


#### Linux
> tested with Ubuntu 16.04

- GNU Radio
```
sudo apt-get install gnuradio
```
- Mono
```
sudo apt-get install mono-devel
```
- PythonNet **(if the following doesn't work, see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section)**
```
sudo -H pip install pythonnet
```
- cmake
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

## macOS
> tested with macOS 10.13 with MacPorts 2.4.2

- GNU Radio
> XQuartz/X11 is a prerequisite for GNU Radio
```
sudo port -v install xorg-server
```

- Python
```
sudo select --set python python27
sudo select --set python2 python27
```

- Mono
```
sudo apt-get install mono-devel
```
- PythonNet **(if the following doesn't work, see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section)**
```
sudo -H pip install pythonnet
```
- cmake
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

### Installing the Block

Once all of the pre-requisites are installed, you can run the build script within the root of the project.

```
cd <repo_director>
sudo ./build.sh
```
This script will do the following:

- Build the Flexlib Mono project with MSBuild (Release Configuration)
- Copy the resulting binaries into the gr-flex module
- create a `build/` directory
- runs `CMake`  (configures make files)
- runs `make`   (builds python module)
- runs `sudo make install`  (installs block into GNU Radio directory)

Here's some sample output from the script (installing into the GNU Radio folders):

### Using the Block
Here's how the **Flex Source** block currently looks in GNU Radio:

![Flex Block](./images/flex-source-block.png)

### Sample Apps
See the sample **GRC** files that have been placed into the `examples/` directory of this repo:

`./examples/flex-source.grc` - sends FlexRadio data to a waterfall plot

## Running the Samples

Running the sample GRC files will show output from the gr-flex block that could potentially help with troubleshooting problems.

The FlexRadio has a discovery mechanism that works on the local area network to allow for applications to discover and configure themselves to interact with the FlexRadio.  

When the Flex Source starts up, it will go through the discovery process and output the results within the terminal.

## Troubleshooting
If you're having problems installing [PythonNet](#pythonnet) the following may help.

- [setuptools](pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) **(At least on Ubuntu 16.04, setuptools is likely outdated which causes problems installing pip as well as pythonnet)**. To check which version you have, run:
```python
python
import setuptools
setuptools.__version
```
The current version is listed at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.
If you need to upgrade it:
```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo -H python get-pip.py
sudo -H pip install setuptools --upgrade
```

- [gliblib](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libglib2.0-dev) **(in ubuntu at least, the following is necessary)**
```
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```

- Finally, try installing pythonnet using an egg by running:
```
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet --egg
```

## Running the tests

Unfortunately since the block requires the presence of a FlexRadio, it makes mocking the block much harder to do.  To test this module, the sample apps were used with a Flex system to test and confirm functionality.
